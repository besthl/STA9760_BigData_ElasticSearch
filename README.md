# STA9760 Project 2 Part 2---Loading Data into ElasticSearch
In this part, we want leverage docker-compose to bring up a service that encapsulates the bigdata1 container and an elasticsearch container and ensures that they are able to interact. 
In order to interact with elasticsearch in python, PyPIâ€™s elasticsearch module ought to be used. Additionally, all elasticsearch related logic should be wrapped into an internal module that lives within the src folder in this project.

## Start:

docker-compose up -d


This will start ElasticSearch and Kibana.

ElasticSearch: http://localhost:9200 Kibana: http://localhost:5601


Running python:

export APP_KEY={MY_TOKEN}

docker-compose run pyth python parking.py --page_size=1000 --num_pages=4


export curl output:

curl -X GET {localhost:9200/parking-violation-index} > output.txt


Shutting off:

docker-compose down
